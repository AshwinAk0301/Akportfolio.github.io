            <p>I designed and developed this Web Application to help 
                the public registering the problem as a complaint<br> through 
                online and getting their problems solved without going to 
                the office. Here we can avoid paying<br> bribes to the staffs 
                working for the complaint raised on online. Also proper 
                updates on the complaint status can<br> be updated in the 
                portal and can be viewed.</p>
